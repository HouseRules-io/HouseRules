Next steps: 

1) fix base.html on everything

2) show user details on masthead

3) house to user authentication

4) "house ruler" form field for house that auto-fills with creator (just connect house to a user)

5) give gray arrow reverse functionality and flip it


Non-pressing problems to fix later:

x) fix rule css

x) fix "create" css
