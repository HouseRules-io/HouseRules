Next steps: 

HALF CHECK 1) make rulebook and rule forms only show options for the user's house/rulebook instead of all of them

2) better config for mobile

3) drag and drop icons

4) custom urls for houses that redirect to house pages


Non-pressing problems to fix later:

x) make rule css prettier

x) fix "create house" css

x) fix login css, connecting to logmein class






may need later:
