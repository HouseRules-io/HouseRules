Next steps: 

1) make rulebook and rule forms only show options for the user's house/rulebook instead of all of them

2) take a long hard think about if any more fields need to be added

3) add sample houses, rulebooks, rules, users

4) upload to gcloud

5) test on gcloud

6) give permissions to nick and chaz


Non-pressing problems to fix later:

x) make rule css prettier

x) fix "create house" css

x) fix login css, connecting to logmein class
