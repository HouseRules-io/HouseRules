Next steps: 

CHECK 1) fix base.html on everything

CHECK 2) show user details on masthead

CHECK 3) house to user authentication // fixing form to have creator field

IRRELEVANT 4) "house ruler" form field for house that auto-fills with creator (just connect house to a user)

5) give gray arrow reverse functionality and flip it


Non-pressing problems to fix later:

x) make rule css prettier

x) fix "create house" css

x) fix login css, connecting to logmein class
